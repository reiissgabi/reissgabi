ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Welcome to my Github profile.
My name is Gabrielle and my nickname is Gabi!
I am 25 years old, and in 2023, I decided to change both my career and country. I previously worked as a nursing technician in Brazil, but now I am fully immersed in the tech world. I completed a Specialist Technician Programming course at IEFP in Portugal, and I am growing in my new career. Currently, I am focused on languages like ReactJS and TypeScript, aiming to enhance my expertise in Front-end development, which is my main area of interest.!
